## Building

You need the following libraries
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
- [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- [TMX C Loader](https://github.com/baylej/tmx) by baylej

If you have the libraries installed, just cd to the root dir and
```
make
```
Shouldn't be too hard.

Windows not tested, works fine on 64-bit Linux Mint.
